## Why This Exists

AI agents can code, review, deploy, and monitor. But they can't govern themselves — and neither can humans govern them through Slack threads and meeting notes.

org-as-code gives AI agents and humans a shared protocol for working together. One agent proposes, another validates. A human steps in when stakes are high. Every handoff is logged, every decision is traceable, every rejection drives a better next iteration. The P↔V protocol doesn't care whether a step is performed by Claude, GPT, a junior developer, or a CTO — it enforces the same rhythm of propose, validate, converge.

This means you can build teams where AI agents do the heavy lifting (proposals, implementations, reviews) while humans retain authority over critical decisions — without bottlenecking every step. The `feature_v2` template demonstrates this: AI handles routine work autonomously, but processes with H(s) ≥ 0.8 automatically require human sign-off.

### What you get

| | Feature | What it does |
|---|---------|-------------|
| **P↔V** | Protocol | Proposals oscillate with Validations — expand options, then contract to decisions |
| **H(s)** | Priority Score | Calculated, not felt: `w₁·urgency + w₂·commitment + w₃·demand + w₄·blocking` |
| **E(x)** | Convergence Score | Quadratic energy — one critical gap outweighs three minor ones |
| **FDM** | Process Dependencies | Cycle detection, parallel groups, impact scoring, living dependency register |
| **JSONL** | Audit Trail | SHA-256 hash-chained, append-only, tamper-evident |
| **MCP** | AI Agent Interface | 21 native tools over stdio transport |
| **CLI** | Human Interface | 23 commands for operators |
| **YAML** | Per-Process State | One state file per process — no merge conflicts |

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/syntriad/org-as-code.git
cd org-as-code
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Register your agents

Edit `registry/agents.yaml`:

```yaml
agents:
  - id: alice
    name: "Alice (Team Lead)"
    type: human
    interface: terminal
    skills: [strategic-review, final-validation, decision-making]
    status: active
    capacity: 5

  - id: coder
    name: "Coder (AI Agent)"
    type: ai
    interface: claude-code
    skills: [implementation, code-generation, testing]
    status: active
    capacity: 10

  - id: reviewer
    name: "Reviewer (AI Agent)"
    type: ai
    interface: ide
    skills: [technical-review, refactoring, testing]
    status: active
    capacity: 5
```

### 3. Start your first process

```bash
python3 org_cli.py create FEAT-001 feature \
  "Add user authentication" \
  "Implement JWT-based auth with refresh tokens" \
  --agent coder --priority 0.8
```

### 4. Let an AI agent validate

The assigned agent creates `V.0_review.yaml` in `processes/FEAT-001/`:

```yaml
verdict: approved
confidence: 0.9
conditions:
  - "Add rate limiting before merge"
reviewed_by: reviewer
```

### 5. Commit and verify

```bash
python3 org_cli.py update FEAT-001 COMMITTED \
  --notes "Auth module complete. All tests pass."

python3 org_cli.py verify
# Chain integrity: VALID — no tampering detected.
```

Every step is logged in `registry/artifacts.jsonl` with hash-chain integrity.

## The P↔V Protocol

Like a heartbeat (systole ↔ diastole), organizations need rhythm:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              P ↔ V Protocol             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│   ┌─────────┐         ┌─────────┐      │
│   │    P    │────────▶│    V    │      │
│   │ Propose │         │Validate │      │
│   └─────────┘         └────┬────┘      │
│        ▲                   │           │
│        │     iterate       │           │
│        └───────────────────┘           │
│                                         │
│   P_READY → P_COMPLETE → V_COMPLETE    │
│                    → COMMITTED          │
│                    → ABANDONED          │
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**P-steps** (Production): Expand options, generate proposals
**V-steps** (Validation): Contract, validate, select

This prevents two failure modes:
- **Unbounded divergence** — chaos, no decisions
- **Frozen convergence** — premature fixation, groupthink

| `org_calculate_energy` | Calculate convergence score E(x) |
| `org_verify_chain` | Verify hash-chain integrity of audit log |

Add to your Claude Code MCP configuration (`~/.claude.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "org-as-code": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["org_mcp_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "ORG_REPO_PATH": "/path/to/org-as-code"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Priority Score

Priority is not a feeling. It is a calculation:

```
H(s) = w₁·urgency + w₂·commitment + w₃·demand + w₄·blocking
```

Default weights (configurable in `protocol/config.yaml`):

| Weight | Value | Component |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| w₁ | 0.30 | Urgency — how time-sensitive |
| w₂ | 0.20 | Commitment — how invested we are |
| w₃ | 0.30 | Demand — external need |
| w₄ | 0.20 | Blocking — how much this blocks other work |

Thresholds:
- **H(s) ≥ 0.8** → Escalate to human
- **H(s) ≥ 0.5** → Action required
- **H(s) < 0.5** → Low priority

*(Formally: the Semantic Hamiltonian — see [THEORY.md](THEORY.md))*

---

## Convergence Score

The priority score tells you *what to work on*. The convergence score tells you *how far from done*:

```
E(x) = w_g·gaps² + w_i·inconsistencies² + w_u·uncertainty² − w_e·evidence²
```

The quadratic penalty means one critical gap (0.9² = 0.81) outweighs three minor ones (3 × 0.3² = 0.27).

| Threshold | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| E(x) < 0.10 | Ready to commit |
| E(x) < 0.30 | Minor revision needed |
| E(x) ≥ 0.30 | Major revision needed |

V-step reviews include convergence scores (gaps, inconsistencies, uncertainty, evidence). The system auto-calculates E(x) and tracks it per process, showing whether iterations are converging, stagnating, or diverging.

*(Formally: Semantic Energy — see [THEORY.md](THEORY.md))*

---

## Process Dependencies (FDM)

Processes can declare dependencies on each other. The system analyzes the dependency graph to detect cycles, compute parallel execution groups, and identify bottlenecks.

```bash
# FEAT-002 depends on FEAT-001
python3 org_cli.py deps-add FEAT-002 FEAT-001

# Full analysis: parallel groups, cycles, critical path
python3 org_cli.py deps-analyze
```

The dependency graph uses Tarjan's SCC algorithm for cycle detection and Kahn's algorithm for topological sort. When circular dependencies are found, the system proposes which edge to break.

**Parallel groups** show which processes can execute simultaneously:
```
Group 1: FEAT-001, BUG-001     (no dependencies — start immediately)
Group 2: FEAT-002              (depends on FEAT-001)
Group 3: FEAT-003              (depends on FEAT-002)
```

**Impact scoring** identifies bottleneck processes — the ones whose delay cascades through the most downstream dependents.

The dependency register (`registry/fdm.json`) is auto-generated after every dependency change, providing a persistent, git-versioned view of the dependency graph.

---

## Hash-Chain Audit Trail

Every action is logged in `registry/artifacts.jsonl` with cryptographic linking:

```json
{
  "type": "p_step",
  "agent": "coder",
  "process_id": "FEAT-001",
  "action": "P.0_proposal",
  "description": "Add user authentication",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-16T14:30:00Z",
  "prev_hash": "a3f8c1...",
  "entry_hash": "7b2e4d..."
}
```

Each entry's `entry_hash` = SHA-256(`prev_hash` + canonical JSON of entry).
Chain integrity is verifiable via CLI (`python3 org_cli.py verify`) or MCP (`org_verify_chain`).

Tamper-evident. Append-only. Git-versioned.

---

## Process Templates

### Feature flow

```yaml
name: feature
steps:
  - name: "P.0 — Proposal"
    artifact: "P.0_proposal.md"
    agent_types: [ai, human]
    next_state: P_COMPLETE

  - name: "V.0 — Review"
    artifact: "V.0_review.yaml"
    agent_types: [ai, human]
    next_state: V_COMPLETE
    requires: P_COMPLETE

  - name: "P.1 — Implementation"
    artifact: "P.1_implementation.md"
    agent_types: [ai]
    next_state: P_COMPLETE

  - name: "V.1 — Verification"
    artifact: "V.1_verification.yaml"
    agent_types: [ai, human]
    next_state: COMMITTED
    requires: P_COMPLETE
```

### Feature v2 flow (with conditional human gate)

`feature_v2.yaml` adds priority-conditional human approval: processes with H(s) ≥ 0.8 require human sign-off at V.1, while low-risk processes (H(s) < 0.5) permit AI-only verification.

---

## Theoretical Foundation

org-as-code is an implementation of the [SYNTRIAD metapattern](https://github.com/SYNTRIAD/genesis):

```
T : (S, I, C) → S'    — every process is a transformation
Ω = P ↔ V             — governed by expand-contract rhythm
V++                    — only validated work persists
```

The priority score H(s) and convergence score E(x) used throughout this tool are domain-specific instances of the Semantic Hamiltonian and Semantic Energy described in [Semantic Thermodynamics](https://zenodo.org/records/17618208).

For the design rationale — why quadratic scoring, how the audit trail works, and where the pattern comes from — see [THEORY.md](THEORY.md).

---

## Use Cases

- **Multi-agent collaboration** — Agent A writes code, Agent B reviews it, a human approves if the priority score warrants it. Each handoff is a P→V transition with a convergence score.
- **Human-AI teams** — Humans set direction (attractors, tensions), AI agents execute (P-steps), either party validates (V-steps). The protocol scales from solo developer + one AI to full teams.
- **Async-first organizations** — Replace meetings with validated artifacts. Every decision has a traceable audit trail, not a Slack thread.
- **Compliance-sensitive environments** — Immutable decision logs for AI Act, SOC2, NIS2. The hash chain provides tamper-evident records of who decided what, when, and why.

---

## Real-World Examples

The `examples/` directory contains two cases from independent evaluations where the P↔V protocol caught errors before they shipped:

- **[SEC-001](examples/SEC-001/)** — A security proposal with two architectural errors (wrong injection model, wrong threat model). The V-step rejected it. The revised proposal shipped the correct fix. 6 artifacts over 5 days.
- **[PERF-001](examples/PERF-001/)** — A performance optimization that would have shipped at the accuracy constraint floor. The V-step caught the cliff-edge risk. The revised plan used ONNX quantization instead, maintaining a safety margin. 4 artifacts over 4 days.

See [`examples/README.md`](examples/README.md) for the full story.

---

## Running Tests

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
```

156 tests cover security validation, hash-chain integrity, agent registration, input sanitization, energy calculation, convergence tracking, per-process state, auto-migration, dependency validation, graph analysis, FDM integration, and CLI commands.

---

## Integration

org-as-code provides two integration paths — no bridge layer needed.

### MCP-compatible agents (Claude Code, Windsurf, Gemini)

Use the MCP server. See [Setup](#setup) above. The agent gets 21 native tools over stdio — no code required.

### Python agent frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI, custom)

Import directly from the server module:

```python
from org_mcp_server import (
    org_create_process,
    org_log_artifact,
    org_update_state,
    org_add_dependency,
    org_analyze_dependencies,
    org_calculate_energy,
    org_read_convergence,
    org_verify_chain,
)

# Create processes with dependencies
org_create_process("FEAT-010", "feature", "Add caching", "Redis-based response cache", "my-agent")
org_create_process("FEAT-011", "feature", "Add cache invalidation", "TTL + event-based", "my-agent",
    depends_on="FEAT-010")

# Add dependency after creation
org_add_dependency("FEAT-012", "FEAT-010")

# Analyze dependency graph
print(org_analyze_dependencies())  # parallel groups, cycles, critical path, bottleneck

# Log a V-step with convergence scores
org_log_artifact("reviewer", "V.0_review", "Approved with conditions",
    process_id="FEAT-010",
    extra='{"convergence": {"gaps": 0.3, "inconsistencies": 0.1, "uncertainty": 0.2, "evidence": 0.7}}')
```

Set `ORG_REPO_PATH` before importing, or the module defaults to its own directory.

### Non-Python frameworks

Call `org_cli.py` as a subprocess. All 23 CLI commands return structured, parseable output.

---

## Known Limitations

We believe in transparency about what this system does and does not do well today:

- **State storage modes.** Default mode is `per_process`: each process stores its state in `processes/{ID}/state.yaml`, eliminating concurrent write conflicts. `registry/state.yaml` is auto-generated as a read-only index. Legacy `monolithic` mode is available via `state_storage.mode: monolithic` in `protocol/config.yaml`. Existing monolithic deployments auto-migrate on first write when switching to `per_process` mode. Advisory file locking (`fcntl.flock`) protects against write corruption within a single host.

- **Security mode.** All write tools validate agent IDs against `registry/agents.yaml` and process IDs against format `[A-Z]+-[0-9]+`. Default mode is `permissive` (logs warnings for unknown agents). Set `security.mode: strict` in `protocol/config.yaml` for production use, which rejects unknown agents from all write tools except `org_log_artifact` (bootstrap exemption). Commit messages are sanitized to prevent git trailer injection.

- **Local tamper-evidence only.** The hash chain provides tamper-evidence but not tamper-resistance. A repository admin with force-push access can rewrite history. For stronger guarantees, consider anchoring chain tips to an external timestamping authority.

---

## Roadmap

v2.3 provides auditable execution: every decision is logged, hash-chained, and verifiable. The next major capability is **auditable authority** — formalizing *who may decide*, not just *what was decided*.

Planned for a future release:

- **Formal role model** — producer, validator, approver, senior approver, auditor as first-class concepts with explicit authorities
- **Decision artifacts** — `D.0_decision.yaml` as auditable governance events, not just V-step metadata
- **Policy-based commit control** — process type and risk class determine required approvals, role coverage, and human gates
- **Conflict resolution** — when validators disagree: consensus, senior override, or mandatory escalation
- **Separation of duties** — a producer may not self-approve; security processes require senior sign-off

This extends the state machine with a `DECISION_PENDING` state between `V_COMPLETE` and `COMMITTED`, and formalizes the relationship between the existing H(s) human gate and the governance layer.

The governance layer will ship when real multi-validator conflict use cases drive the design — not before.
